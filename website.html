        <h3>Alarm Clock - Final Android App</h3>
        <p>Have you ever had trouble getting out of bed in the morning? The other creators of this app and I sure have!
          To solve this practical, every day issue we have we decided to create an alarm clock app that would get us out of bed.
          Our alarm clock is clean and simplistic, but sports all the features you could want from an alarm clock: a settable alarm time,
          an annoying buzzer sure to get you out of bed and even includes out "shake to snooze" function which pauses the alarm for 100
          seconds if you shake your phone. </p></div>
        <p>You can download the .apk file for our wonderful and functional alarm clock <a href=https://goo.gl/frdquQ target="_blank" alt="Downlod .apk">here</a>.
        <p class="psectionheader">Process and Challenges</p>
        <p>One of the most difficult aspects of programming the alarm clock was the snooze function. It required setting up another
          clock sensor separate from the one that our app's clocks are based around and App Inventor has limits for countdown timers
          so rather than being able to set the snooze for say five minutes and countdown, we had to have it set for 100 seconds so it
          could display the countdown for the user to see.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Another challenge we faced was getting the alarm sound itself to a) not play over itself, as it runs on an interval of the
           internal clock which is also keeping the clock text updated to the current time and b) not play when the app is first
           opened, as the clock text and the alarm time text are the same. Both of these had rather easy fixes when we got more
           creative. For a​, we simply added a variable we called "OneSound" that is set to true when the alarm sound plays. Then,
           when the next time Internal Clock time interval comes around it does not execute the code as it only runs under the
           condition that the "OneSound" variable is false. We used a variable to solve b also, creating a variable called "Clockable"
           which is initialized to false and turns true when the user syncs the clock with their phone's clock. The alarm sound can only
           play if the clock text is equal to the alarm text, and "Clockable" is true. </p>
